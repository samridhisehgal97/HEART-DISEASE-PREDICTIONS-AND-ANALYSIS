# HEART-DISEASE-PREDICTIONS-AND-ANALYSIS
Objective: -  
Explore the heart disease dataset using exploratory data analysis (EDA) and 
Exercise with classification algorithms for prediction (modelling)

This project will focus on predicting heart disease using neural networks. Based on attributes such as blood pressure, cholestoral levels, heart rate, and other characteristic attributes, patients will be classified according to varying degrees of coronary artery disease.
